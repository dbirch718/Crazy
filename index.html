         <p> I work very hard at a factory making envelopes. The work I do seems to go unnoticed, so that is why I am learning and mastering web development. It is time for a change in my career so I chose to become the best Web Developer I can be. </p>

                <h2> BIG DREAMS </h2>
                <h4> Be a Web Developer </h4>
                <p> I have learned basic web development skills. I am learning to apply what I have learned build some websites. I am hoping to build a few websites in the near future. The biggest challenge will be to add the interaction part to the website. </p>

               <p> I am beginning to learn how to make web pages. I have been learning for a few months. The more I am experiencing writing and building sample sites, it is getting much easier. I enjoy doing this type of work. I am also learning JavaScript, Python, Html, CSS, and just started mongo and node on the backend to add a little to my skills. </p>

               <p> They didnt offer me a job but I made myself as a Remote Web Developer.  I made their website and showed it to them. They liked what I did. I uploaded the content. I really liked working with Programming Hero. It has helped me tremendously. </p>
